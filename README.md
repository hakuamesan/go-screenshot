# go-screenshot
Take a screenshot of the screen and autosave the image in ~/Pictures dir with timestamp as filename. When configured with a keyboard shortcut, it saves a lot of time and effort to quickly capture the screen. Similar to Cmd+Shift+3 on a Mac.

For me, tt was hard to take a screenshot that automatically saved the files without prompting for either filename or path. 

The files are saved by default to ~/Pictures folder, will be able to change that option later.
